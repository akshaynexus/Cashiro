/**
 * Maps raw [Throwable] messages from the on-device LLM runtime into strings that are
 * meaningful to a user.
 *
 * JNI and class-loading failures routinely surface with a bare class name or an opaque
 * linker string as the exception message (for example a `NoClassDefFoundError` whose
 * message is just the class it failed to load). Neither tells a user anything actionable,
 * so they are replaced with a generic prompt. Human-readable messages pass through
 * untouched so genuine failures remain diagnosable from the UI.
